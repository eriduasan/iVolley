    <!-- Volleyball FAQ -->

    <string name="faq_volleyball_scoring_title">How Do You Score In Volleyball?</string>
    <string name="faq_volleyball_scoring_body">
        The overall objective of volleyball is for each athlete to use skill involving teams passing a ball over the net without the ball touching the ground or going out of bounds. A ball dropping on the line counts as in bounds.
        \n\n
        There are a lot of different plays that are used in order to return the ball over the net, including: a pass, set or a hit, which can be very exciting in playing the sport but also in watching teams play as well.
        \n\n
        Teams earn points when their opponent errors, or fails to legally return the ball over the net. The team earning the most points in a volleyball game wins.
        \n\n
        Each game or another team that can be used is a set, a set is played to 25 points and there are usually 3-5 sets within each match depending on the level, where different rules are applied.
    </string>

    <string name="faq_what_to_wear_title">What Do You Wear To Play Volleyball?</string>
    <string name="faq_what_to_wear_body">
        Figuring out what to wear depends on whether you are playing indoor or outdoor, and competitively or for fun.
        \n\n
        Indoor volleyball practice calls for a t-shirt, athletic shorts, socks, court shoes, and knee pads. Your formal game gear will include a jersey, shorts, socks, shoes, and knee pads.
        \n\n
        Beach volleyball players wear swimsuits, sports bikinis, spandex tops and bottoms, full body suits, or shorts and tank-tops, depending on what their league allows it or not.
    </string>

    <string name="faq_libero_title">What Is A Libero?</string>
    <string name="faq_libero_body">
        The word \‘Libero\' is an Italian word meaning "free". As in football, soccer, and other sports, indoor volleyball uses defensive specialists called liberos.
        \n\n
        Two liberos may be chosen from a team of twelve or more players, but only one "acting libero" can be on the court at a time. Not every team has to have a libero, though. According to FIVB rules, teams have the option to designate up to two liberos for a tournament from among the list of players.
    </string>

    <string name="faq_libero_color_title">Which Player In Volleyball Wears A Different Color?</string>
    <string name="faq_libero_color_body">
        Volleyball liberos wear different colored jerseys to have them stand out from their teammates.
    </string>

    <string name="faq_libero_diff_title">How Is A Libero Different Than Other Volleyball Players?</string>
    <string name="faq_libero_diff_body">
        Liberos follow a little different set of rules. The libero was added to the indoor volleyball game in 1999 to liven up the game. The main differences between the libero and a defense specialist involve duties and substitution.
        \n\n
        The Libero can only rotate in for back-row players, wears a different color of jersey, can only serve for one player, cannot jump or attack, must sit out one play before returning to the game and when used as a substitute it doesn’t count against the team’s six substitutions per set that are allowed.
        \n\n
        A defensive specialist, on the other hand, can rotate in for any player, they are allowed to jump and attack a hit and when they are used as a substitute it does count against the team’s six allowed substitutions per set.
